# Output Materials for Synthetic Data Generation Framework for the ForestType Dataset

This folder contains all the output artifacts from the synthetic data generation and evaluation pipeline. These materials are designed to be self-contained and reproducible, and they can be zipped and shared with others for further analysis or deployment.

## Contents

- **Trained Models:**  
  Trained machine learning models (Logistic Regression) saved as pickle files.
  
- **Configuration Files:**  
  JSON files detailing the pipeline configuration, including dataset information, preprocessing steps, synthetic data generation parameters, and evaluation metrics.  
  *Filename:* `VAEForestPipelineConfig.json`

- **Model Cards:**  
  Markdown files that document each model's details, including:
  - Overview and intended use
  - Dataset information (original vs. augmented)
  - Preprocessing details
  - Hyperparameters and training details
  - Evaluation metrics and performance results
  - Ethical and bias considerations

- **Evaluation Outputs:**  
  Files containing evaluation metrics.

## How to Use

1. **Review Configuration:**  
   Open the configuration JSON files to see the exact parameters and settings used during the pipeline execution.

2. **Examine Model Cards:**  
   Each model card provides a detailed description of the corresponding model. Use these documents to understand how the model was trained, evaluated, and any known limitations or ethical concerns.

3. **Load and Deploy Models:**  
   Trained models can be loaded using joblib (or pickle). For example:
   ```python
   import joblib
   model = joblib.load("model.pkl")
